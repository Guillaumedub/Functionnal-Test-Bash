Create a simple bash file named `my_test.sh` that can be executed and that do nothing

## ex01
Now that you can execute you bash file, make it print `[PASS]` if we give you 1 argument or `[FAIL]` otherwise.  
For example `my_test.sh` will print `[FAIL]`  
For example `my_test.sh arg` will print `[PASS]`  

## ex02
Extend the functionality of my_test.sh to perform the following:
    Check if a file named file_to_check.txt exists in the workspace directory.
    Print [PASS] if the file exists.
    Print [FAIL] if the file does not exist.
